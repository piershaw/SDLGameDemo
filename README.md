# SDLGameDemo
My C++ graphics SDL Demo made with C4Driod IDE in my car
so for exturnal IDE use
VC++ Directories has the SDL includes Directories and the Library Directories pick x86 or x64
C/C++ has the additional includes Directories
then the linker has the libraries Directories SDL2.lib and SDLmain.lib

problems fix so I wont have to work so hard again
// ahh so SDL needs main(int argc, char *argv[]) not main() it cant be empty or SDLmain.dll will not be called
// also but the SDL2.dll file in the root project
